Analyze the current test coverage and generate tests for uncovered code paths.

Steps:
1. Run `npm test -- --coverage` and review the coverage report
2. Identify files and functions with less than 80% coverage
3. For each uncovered code path:
   - Understand what the code does
   - Write a test that exercises that path
   - Include edge cases and error conditions
4. Run the tests and fix any failures
5. Re-run coverage to confirm improvement

Output a summary:
- Starting coverage percentage
- Number of new tests written
- Any bugs discovered during testing
- Final coverage percentage
